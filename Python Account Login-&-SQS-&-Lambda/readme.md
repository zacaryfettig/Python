# Python Chat Messaging Application
Flask Python Web Application that uses PostgreSQL to store user data. Creation and login of a user references the database for login credentials and logs them in if their username/password is correct. SocketIO Server takes the information from the message input box and uploads it to the server. The server then distributes the messages out to the other users.
